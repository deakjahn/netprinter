# NetPrinter

### Network printing made simple

Do you have a printer, maybe an older one, that you would like to print to from your phone or tablet? An inkjet or a black-and-white or color laser? Something even its manufacturer doesn't support any more? Or they want to force you to subscribe to some cloud printing service to use it?

This is an app to allow you to print to a network printer directly from your device. Yes, on your home or office network, behind your own router and firewall. There is no cloud, nothing uploaded, nothing sent out, no registration, no external service to depend upon: everything happens on your own internal network â€“ between your device and your printer.

Just check that your printer understands one of the many supported printer languages directly:

- PDF
- PWG (IPP Everywhere)
- PCLm, PCLmS (Mopria)
- Airprint/URF (Apple)
- PostScript
- PCL 3 GUI (Hewlett-Packard)
- PCL 5/5c (Hewlett-Packard)
- PCL 6e/XL (Hewlett-Packard)
- HP-GL/2 RTL (Hewlett-Packard)
- ESC/P2 (Epson)
- ESC/P-R (Epson)
- ESC/PAGE (Epson)
- GDI host-based (many)
- XPS (Windows)
- ESC/POS (Epson)
- P-Touch (Brother)
- StarPRNT (Star Micronics)
- TSPL/TSPL2 (TSC)
- ZPL, EPL (Zebra)

and it's connected to your local network (or your device) using one of the many supported connections:

- Ethernet
- WiFi
- WiFi Direct
- Bluetooth
- USB OTG (On-The-Go)

and protocols:

- RAW (JetDirect, AppSocket, Port 9100, TCPmon)
- LPD/LPR
- IPP/CUPS (Linux or Mac)
- Samba (Windows)
- WSD (Windows)
- UPnP
- FTP

You can configure the printer manually or automatically with:

- Bonjour/Avahi/ZeroConf
- WiFi Direct/Mopria
- Bluetooth, Smart/LE
- IPP/CUPS
- Samba
- WSD
- UPnP

The app adds all your configured printers to Android and they will be available for any app that's capable to print: be it an e-mail app, calendar, document editor, game or whatever else.

The paid version, in addition to removing the ads, rewards your support with several extra features:

- use the server mode (see below),
- when you print several images to a page, they are printed in a collage layout instead of a simple, boring grid, with adaptive sizes to show each image in full, without cropping;
- you can select from several display (dithering) options to make printing both black-and-white and colored image material much more interesting;
- you can enlarge a smaller page to fit the page size of the printer;
- you can change the brightness of the printout;
- you can use non-uniform printer resolutions.

## Server mode

The app is also capable of the reverse operation: instead of printing to a printer on your network, it can provide the print server that you can print to from your other network devices. Practically, you can connect your printer with an USB OTG adapter to your phone (maybe to an older phone no longer used) and it will become a full-fledged print server supporting the protocols above, accepting incoming print jobs from all your other mobile devices or computers, too.

## Beta program

If you find problems with your printer and you're willing to experiment a little, please, consider joining the [beta program](https://play.google.com/apps/testing/hu.co.tramontana.netprinter). The development version might already offer better support or more features for your printer and your feedback will help us make the app even better.

### Version 1.19

This version is a major rewrite of the GDI printer support. These are host-based, Windows printers that depend on their full printing knowledge built into the software driving them. The printer has no printer language intelligence of its own and expects the full page to be rendered as a complete bitmap on the host computer. This makes them both cheaper and relatively slow to print to, especially in color.

And precisely this was the reason for the rewrite. Up to 300 dpi, there's no change but above that, the page is now rendered in stripes rather than in full. This reduces the memory requirements dramatically because there's no need to keep the full, high resolution page in memory any more. Also, it made it possible to utilize the multiple processor cores in today's mobile devices, rendering in parallel, resulting in speedups of up to ten times in some cases. The bitmap compression operations were also carefully optimized to avoid any time wasted by unnecessarily copying bitmap data between the various stages of operation.

With a major rewrite, new bugs can creep in. Please, report any problems here so that it can be fixed to arrive at an even better, more performant version of the app. Thanks for your help and co-operation.
